# Contributing to the Microagentic Stacking (MAS) Manifesto 🤝

Thank you for your interest in refining this standard! The goal of MAS is to eradicate fragile, "prompt-engineered" demos and build robust AI architecture for the enterprise. As a living standard, we rely on the expertise of engineers, software architects, and data scientists to evolve.

There are several ways you can contribute:

## 1. Translations 🌍

We want this manifesto to be globally accessible. If you are fluent in a language not currently listed on the main page (or want to improve an existing translation), please open a Pull Request adding the file to the `/translations` folder.

## 2. Refining Principles 💡

Do you believe one of the MAS laws needs more clarity? Have you discovered a new architecture pattern that aligns with this philosophy?

- Open an **Issue** to debate the concept.
- Once a consensus is reached, submit a **Pull Request** with the suggested changes.

## 3. Use Cases & Reference Architectures 🏗️

The "RFP Engine" (Point 7) is just the beginning. We want to document more real-world examples:

- Describe an agentic workflow that follows MAS principles.
- Diagrams (Mermaid or images) and pseudocode for contracts (Pydantic/JSON Schema) are highly encouraged in the `/examples` folder.

## 4. Evangelism & Tooling 📣

If you have built a tool that facilitates MAS implementation or written an article about it:

- Add it to the **[Awesome MAS List](./AWESOME.md)** via a PR.

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a **feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-improvement`).
3. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages.
4. Submit a **Pull Request** detailing why your change adds value to the standard.

## Code of Conduct

We value rigorous technical debate that is constructive and respectful. Our common goal is to elevate AI engineering to a serious professional discipline.
