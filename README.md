# The Microagentic Stacking (MAS) Manifesto 🚀

**From Prompt Alchemy to Scalable Software Engineering.**

The era of the "Monolithic Prompt" is over. As AI systems move into mission-critical enterprise environments, the industry is shifting from black-box chatbots to **Compound AI Systems**.

**Microagentic Stacking (MAS)** is a framework and philosophy for orchestrating specialized, atomic, and decoupled cognitive units to solve complex business processes.

---

## 📑 Core Pillars

* **Process Over AI:** The business logic defines the flow; AI is simply a component.
* **Atomicity Over Generality:** Solve complexity by breaking it into the smallest possible cognitive units.
* **Incremental Growth:** Systems evolve layer by layer, from a simple MVP to a complex ecosystem.

---

## 🛠 Technical Principles (The MAS Laws)

1. **Atomic Responsibility (SRP):** One agent, one specific cognitive task.
2. **Black Box Isolation:** Orchestrators shouldn't care about prompts or models, only inputs and outputs.
3. **Strict Design by Contract:** Rigid Input/Output schemas (JSON/Pydantic) are mandatory.
4. **Hierarchical Orchestration:** Complex intelligence emerges from the assembly, not the individual model.

## ⚖️ Governance & Robustness

MAS introduces **Prompt SemVer**, **Atomic Accountability** (cryptographic metadata for every output), and **Fail-Fast validation**. We don't build demos; we build architecture.
